        <p class = "aboutme">
            Welcome to my page!  My name is Sam and I am currently working toward becoming a full stack web developer.
            I am enrolled at Coding Bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania.  Also, I practice coding using Code Academy and watch a lot of YouTube videos about coding and web development.
            These videos include coding tutorials and stories from current web developers about their current jobs and how they found them.
            I want to become a web developer because I want a career that consists of creating and improving web platforms so that people can accomplish tasks more effeciently.
            I love that the technology always changes (New stuff is the best!) and thorougly enjoy problem solving.  From watching YouTube I've learning web development contains not only using your creative side but also your problem solving side.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class = "aboutme">
            Prior to wanting become a web developer I worked in higher education.  I have a Bachelors Degree in Sociology from Temple University and a Master's in Higher Education Counseling/Student Affairs from West Chester University.
            Some of my other hobbies outside of web development include watching sports (mainly football), smartphones, video games, and pretending that I go to the gym.
